	<p>I am web developer and more focused on the frontend. I use HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, Angular JS, bootstrap front end framework, and Laravel PHP-framework to make responsive and eye catching web apps. I also use with PHP and MySQL for the backend in my hobby web projects. In addition, I have good understanding and implementation skills of MVC design patterns and object oriented programing techniques.I am also very familiar with GitHub source control and Jira bug tracking and project management tools.</p>

	I love to fight until I succeed and for the most part I get things done. This is my day to day life 
	experience. Software development specifically on the web frontend part has always been my passion. 
	I am very ready and ambitious to learn new technologies as well in these areas to become more competent 
	and useful. </br>
