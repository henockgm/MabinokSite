			<p class="greetings"><strong>Dear Sir or Madam:</strong></p> 
			I am web developer and more focused on the frontend. I use HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, 
			JQuery, Angular JS, bootstrap front end framework, and Laravel PHP-framework to make 
			responsive and eye catching web apps. I also use PHP and MySQL for the backend in 
			my hobby web projects. In addition, I have good understanding and implementation skills of 
			MVC design patterns and object oriented programing techniques.I am also very familiar with 
			GitHub source control and Jira bug tracking and project management tools.<br /><br />

			Personally I like new challenges and problems and I like solving them. Giving up is not my option. 
			I love to fight until I succeed and for the most part I get things done. This is my day to day life 
			experience. Software development specifically on the web frontend part has always been my passion. 
			I am very ready and ambitious to learn new technologies as well in these areas to become more competent 
			and useful. </br>
			Please refer to my cv or my cv-website 
			<a href="http://www.mabinok.com" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none"> mabinok.com </a> 
			which gives you more complete information about my competences and background.
			I am looking forward hearing from you and proceed with this employment opportunity.
